"Bigger or better: the relative benefits of protected area network expansion and enforcement for the conservation of an exploited species." by Caitlin D. Kuempel, Vanessa M. Adams, Hugh P. Possingham and Michael Bode

Repository contains two files that together will create Figure 2, which depicts the impacts of protected area expansion on total species abundance under a fixed enforcement budget. The two files are "Create_diluting_plot.m" and "submodel.m". The first function calls the second, sending it different levels of protection.
